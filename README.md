Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Newspaper FullStack Website on your local machine.

🛠 Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
✅ Node.js (Latest LTS Version)
✅ MongoDB (or use MongoDB Atlas)
✅ Git

📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:<br>
git clone https://github.com/raselm282/assignment11-clients.git
cd newspaper-full-stack-12


⚙️ Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following variables:

env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
Replace your_mongodb_connection_string, your_secret_key, and your_firebase_api_key with your actual credentials.

🗄 Step 3: Start the Backend Server
In the backend folder, start the Node.js server:
npm run dev
By default, the server runs on http://localhost:5000.

🌐 Step 4: Start the Frontend
Go back to the frontend folder and run:
npm start
By default, the React app runs on http://localhost:3000.

🚀 Step 5: Open the Application
Once both frontend and backend are running, open your browser and visit:
🔗 http://localhost:3000

Now, you can explore the Newspaper FullStack Website! 🎉

🛠 Troubleshooting
If MongoDB is not running locally, use MongoDB Atlas and update the connection string in .env.
If ports conflict, change them in .env and package.json.
